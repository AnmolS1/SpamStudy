Email addresses entered into the Email field on a HubSpot form are immediately validated by HubSpot. If the email address is not valid (does not exist, is misspelled, etc.), the form cannot be submitted.
You can provide additional protection against spam form submissions by enabling CAPTCHA and blocking specific email domains or free email providers.
CAPTCHA adds a step to your form verifying that a visitor is not a robot before they can submit the form. To enable CAPTCHA on a form:
In your HubSpot account, navigate to Marketing > Lead Capture > Forms.
Click the name of a form.
In the left pane, locate the Other Form Elements section and click to toggle the Captcha (SPAM Prevention) switch on.
In the top right, click Publish.
If you enable CAPTCHA, Google's invisible reCAPTCHA will appear on your form when you add the form to a page. If Google determines that a visitor is suspicious, they must solve a CAPTCHA challenge before they can submit the form.
Please note:
if your regular form or pop-up form includes a follow-up email, a CAPTCHA will automatically be added to the form. To remove the CAPTCHA from the form, delete the follow-up emails in the Follow-up tab of the form editor.
If CAPTCHA has been enabled on the form, form submissions from the Submit data for a form API or other form integrations will not be accepted. 
You can block specific email domains or free email providers on your form to encourage your visitors to provide high-quality business email addresses.
