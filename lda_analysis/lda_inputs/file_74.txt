If your Inbox is getting cluttered with spam and junk mail, use these helpful tips to help get your Inbox back under control. While most spam should be caught by our filters, occasionally some can slip through. If that does happen it's important to mark the email as spam. It lets our system learn that messages from a specific sender are not good and helps us make Yahoo Mail even better at recognizing future spam emails.
