Thank you for purchasing our product. I understand that after installing Maximum Security you start to receive more spam mail. As part of Maximum Security, an Antispam Toolbar feature is available for mail programs installed on your PC. (e.g. MS Outlook). If you have set up the mail program to receive mails from external email services like Gmail and Yahoo Mail, the spams from those email accounts will be filtered. If you haven't enabled our Antispam Toolbar in your mail client, please try it and let us know if it helps or not.
