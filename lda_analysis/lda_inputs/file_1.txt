Tired of having your mailbox crammed with ads and other mail you didn’t ask for, like preapproved credit card applications? The good news is that there are ways you can cut down on how much unsolicited mail you get.
You can decide what types of mail you do and don’t want from marketers. Register at the Direct Marketing Association's (DMA) consumer website DMAchoice.org, and choose what catalogs, magazine offers, and other mail you want to get. You’ll have to pay a $2 processing fee, and your registration will last for 10 years.
The site also offers the option to stop mail from being sent to someone who’s deceased or to a dependent in your care.
DMAchoice.org also has an Email Preference Service that lets you get less unsolicited commercial email. To learn more about what else you can do about unwanted email, read our article on email spam.
