Maybe you're opening up your inbox every morning and realizing that you don't recognize as many of the sender names as you used to, or maybe you're finding yourself spending more and more time deleting and archiving messages coming your way, regardless of what exactly you're experiencing, you've likely noticed the issue â€” there's more spam than there used to be. And it's not just you, spam emails are on the rise across the board and people are struggling to find ways to stop spam email. As many of the free email services we use day to day are getting older, more spam than usual has been able to get through their automatic filters. Spam messages are getting smarter and the standard filters are having a hard time keeping up. Unfortunately spam emails are more than simple annoyances, they can also be incredibly dangerous. Phishing emails from these spam messagers are created to trick you into handing over sensitive information or even download dangerous malware. For those wondering to themselves, "Why am I getting spam emails?" the answer is quite simply that spam emails are more profitable now than ever before. No longer the Nigerian prince emails of old, many of these spam messagers send targeted messages pretending to be legitimate companies such as Netflix or DHL to convince you to hand over your credit card information. This dangerous rise in phishing emails leaves recipients like you asking what you can do to manage and even stop spam email. Luckily there are some steps you can take to protect yourself from the dangers of spam emails.
Despite all the spam fighting software in the world today, one of the best steps you can take to stop spam email from causing you any harm is simply by slowing down to inspect the message and ensure that it's legitimate. These steps include checking the sender, figuring out what they're asking for, and determining if the offer is too good to be true. Email spammers have gotten smarter about formatting their missives so they appear to be legitimate. They may feature the logo of a company you frequently purchase from or may be formatted to look exactly like a previous email you've received. However there's a good chance they may have neglected to change the email sender name. So if you receive a message claiming your credit card is overdrafted or that an item you didn't order is en route, you should first check to see who the sender is. There's a high likelihood that it's an address along the lines of deals@123864.com or even a slight misspelling of the spoofed sender. Regardless, it can be helpful to copy and search for that email sender on Google to see if anyone else has dealt with spam messages from that specific sender. While this may not stop you from getting spam emails, this can definitely help you protect yourself from them. One of the telltale signs of a spam email is that they often ask for sensitive personal information such as your credit card number or social security number right off the bat. These phishing scams will often impersonate companies you regularly purchase from with claims that you need to re-enter your credit card information, that your account has been hacked, or that an item you never purchased is in transit. These emails will often have an urgent tone to them so that you drop caution to the wind and immediately provide the information they've requested. These scams may also pretend to be a government agency offering a certain amount of money as long as the recipient either provides their checking account information or sends the agency money first. We covered many of the most common phishing scams from the last couple years in our 2020 phishing epidemic blog so you can arm yourself with knowledge that keeps you from falling for a phishing attempt. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. This unfortunately goes doubly for any offer you see in your inbox. Another scam tactic that many email spammers have adopted is providing an offer that simply sounds so good that the recipient throws caution to the wind and jumps on the chance. Some of the common examples of these types of scams include fake companies selling the newest iPhone for $100 or a $12,000 tax rebate from the government if you first wire them some funds. While this advice won't stop spam email, it'll help you avoid falling for phishing attacks.
While the methods above help you figure out what to do once you've clicked on a spam email, there are some other tips that can help you stop getting spam emails in general. Whether it's by using software meant to block spam, avoiding any interaction, or even using an alternate address, there are various methods you can employ to stop spam email from invading your inbox because quite frankly we all need help when trying to stop spam emails. Hotmail, Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo, it doesn't matter which email service you have, you can likely do with a helping hand.
As spam email is such a big issue today, there's an entire industry of software products built to help those trying to figure out how to stop spam emails for good. These software products often work with your existing email service provider as an additional layer of spam control on top of the ones that already come standard with the email service and can be one of the best ways to stop spam emails. Edison Mail is a similar email spam filter software that protects you from the dangers of email spam. Edison Mail offers a premium add-on called Edison Mail+ which proactively warns you of any malicious emails as they enter your inbox. This feature conducts four levels of deep-scanning to verify whether or not the message is authentic or if the sender's address has been found in a spam database. Edison Mail+ is designed to offer protection for the 98% of emails that are otherwise unchecked. Just as people advise you to not pick up any spam callers as picking up alerts them that the phone number is in use, you should avoid clicking on any suspected spam emails as often as possible. Many emails from spammers come with spy pixels embedded within them that alert the sender of any opens or clicks on the message. If you open one of these emails it's likely that that's exactly what the spam sender needed to confirm that the email address is still in use and can be targeted in the future. However if you accidentally opened the message without realizing, hope isn't lost. Just make sure that you never click on any links or attachments that came with the email. If you're still wondering, "why am I getting spam emails?" there's a good chance that your email address may be viewable by the public. Just as you wouldn't leave your phone number listed publicly, you should avoid having your email address readily available for the general public. Spammers can use bots to troll through social media in order to collect as many of these email addresses as possible. To make sure that your email address is hidden, check your social media accounts to ensure that your email address is only visible to yourself or close contacts. For some reason if you need to have your email address visible to the general public (i.e. if you're a journalist who gets tips via your email) you can cut down on the amount of spam you receive by reformatting your address. Instead of john.smith@gmail.com, write something along the lines of john [dot] smith [at] gmail. A final option that works as a last ditch effort for many is simply creating a brand new email address. You can use one address as the address you provide when you're online shopping or need to provide your email address for one offer or another, and use the other address for more personal matters. With a throwaway address receiving the bulk of your spam messages, it's much easier to ignore them. Luckily if you'd like to keep on top of both addresses without having to toggle between apps, there are good options for you. Edison Mail is one of these email management solutions that helps you keep multiple email addresses in a single place. You can view them as a single unified inbox or switch between the two with a single tap.
