Keep unwanted emails out of your Comcast email account with spam blockers and email filters.
Make Sure Your Inbox Is Safe
Now that you've set up your Comcast email, you don't want your inbox to get bogged down by spam and other unwanted emails. Xfinity Connect lets you turn on Comcast spam filters and create other email filters to keep your inbox clean. Here's how to make sure your inbox stays organized and safe.
Spam Filters
Xfinity Connect email lets you set spam blockers with a Comcast email spam filter.
Spam Filtering places emails designated as spam in a separate Spam folder.
You can check and see if any legitimate email was marked as spam by accident and use the toolbar to mark it Not Spam.
Emails marked as Spam and moved to the Spam folder will be deleted automatically after seven days.
Turning Spam Filtering off sends all emails directly into your inbox â€“ even those designated as spam.
Follow the simple steps below to change your Comcast spam filter settings.
Change Spam Filter Preferences
Open Xfinity Connect.
Click the Gear icon on the top-right of the navigation bar, then click Email Settings.

Email Safe List
The Email Safe List, found under Settings > Advanced Settings in Xfinity Connect, lets you list the only email addresses from which you want to receive emails.
Note: If you use this feature, you will only receive messages from the addresses you specify. Messages from other addresses not included on the list will be rejected.
Set Up Email Filters
You can also set up multiple email filters with your Comcast email account. An email filter can help sort your messages into different folders, such as folders for all family or work emails.
There are two parts to a filter: the condition, which determines if an email is affected by the filter, and the action, which determines what to do with the email.
